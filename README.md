# Machine Learning Project: Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The dataset used contains customer demographics, services, account information, and whether the customer has churned. The objective is to build models that accurately classify whether a customer will churn based on these features.
